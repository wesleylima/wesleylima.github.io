How AR is the last stand for human self determination

## What is AR
AR is the penultimate computing interface. It's an advancement so profound it will only be super-ceded by a direct mind machine interface.

While it won't be the last medium, the leap from smartphones to AR will be the greatest. Past or present. Not only will it swallow the role of every medium before it. It will deeply, literally and irreversibly change the nature of reality itself.


Every medium since we first created media has been exploited to influence behavior and warp perception in ways that benefit the medium"owner" with no regard --and often to the detriment -- of the target. This is really just a cute way of saying advertisement and propaganda (the same word in Portuguese). I will call it all propaganda.
As the medium becomes more sophisticated so does the power of propaganda to shape behavior.

We know it works because people spend money on it .

Devices become extensions of our selves.
This reaches an apex with AR

Smartphones alter human behavior

AR can alter human behavior more powerfully than smartphones by at least a factor of 10
Literally shaping your paradigm at a whim

Software on AR computers must BELONG to the user or else we will become slaves to the true owners
